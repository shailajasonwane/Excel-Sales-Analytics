ATLIQ-Sales-and-Finance-report

Through this project, I learned how to work with real-world sales data to analyze business performance from multiple perspectives, including customer, product, market, and financial (P&L) analysis. I developed a strong understanding of how to evaluate year-over-year sales growth, interpret customer-level performance, and identify both top revenue contributors and high-growth emerging accounts using structured data.

I learned how rapid overall revenue growth (304.5% YoY in 2021) can sometimes hide revenue concentration risks, where a few large customers such as Amazon and AtliQ-owned channels contribute a significant share of total sales. This helped me understand the importance of balancing growth with risk diversification

By analyzing P&L statements, I gained practical exposure to financial metrics such as Net Sales, COGS, Gross Margin, and GM%, and learned how margins can decline even when sales increase, highlighting the importance of cost control alongside revenue growth.

I also learned how to analyze product-level performance, identifying top-performing and newly launched products, and understanding how product mix contributes to overall revenue growth. This improved my ability to connect product strategy with business outcomes.

Additionally, the market and country-level analysis helped me understand how different regions perform against targets, teaching me how to evaluate geographic performance gaps and prioritize high-revenue markets like India, the USA, and South Korea.

Overall, this project strengthened my skills in data analysis, business interpretation, and storytelling, and taught me how to transform raw data into actionable insights that can support strategic decision-making in sales, pricing, and market expansion.
